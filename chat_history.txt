Given the provided information that there are no available flights from Lihue to San Francisco, Oakland, or San Jose on the dates of March 27th, 28th, or 29th, 2022, it is not possible to arrange a 3-day trip from Lihue to San Francisco within the specified time frame. 

Alternative suggestions:
1. Postpone the trip to a later date when flights are available.
2. Consider alternative destinations within Kauai or the neighboring Hawaiian Islands that are accessible by inter-island travel options such as local flights or ferries.
3. Explore Lihue and the island of Kauai if the travelers are not local residents, as there are many attractions and activities to enjoy.

If postponing the trip is the preferred option, please provide new dates for the travel plan, and I will assist with the updated arrangements. If exploring Kauai is of interest, I can provide a detailed plan for activities and accommodations within the island.
